**Introduction:**

The MAon Version describes martial arts as an entity of embodied knowledge on top of intangible cultural heritage. 

MAon Version 1.1 expands on the technical characteristics with philosophical considerations, consequently providing new perspectives for interpreting the embodied knowledge in martial arts.

The Named Individuals delivers a comprehensive semantic datafication of essential technical concepts in three iconic styles of Southern Chinese Martial Art (Hung Kuen, White Crane, and Choy Li Fut) and an instantiation of the entire Taming the Tiger form set (工字伏虎拳).

**Update history:**
- Updates in V1.1.2 We have revised the terminology to convey the concept more accurately. 
-- Renaming the class "Form_movement" (previously "Form") and, accordingly, the object properties "in_form" (previously "is_form_in") and "similar_movement_to" (previously "similar_form_to"). 
-- The class "Armament" has been renamed to "Weaponry" to reflect the convention of Asian martial arts better. These refinements were made following a comprehensive review by a bilingual master, who recommended this change.

- Updates in V1.1.1 We have renamed the object property "contains" to "has component". This property inherits the CIDOC-CRM declaration of "P148 has component" and indicates the relationship between a form and the technique(s) trained within. This refinement was made following the review by a CIDOC-CRM expert.
